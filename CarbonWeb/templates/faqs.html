              <h2>Why does the test fail on my website?</h2>
              <p>
                We sometimes have trouble testing a url. This is generally for one
                of two reasons:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>If your website is very slow, the test may time out.</li>
                <li>
                  If there are routing issues in your DNS settings, it can make it
                  impossible for our test to load the page
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Please check your load times and DNS settings before asking us to
                investigate a failed test.
              </p>
              <h2>I use green hosting, but your test says I don’t. Why?</h2>
              <p>
                Sometimes we cannot detect green hosting for the following
                reasons:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If your hosting provider has not registered the IP address of
                  your server with
                  <a
                    href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >The Green Web Foundation</a
                  >, we will not be able to detect it. Please check with your
                  hosting provider to see if this is the case.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you are using a CDN, then we will not be able to identify the
                  IP address of your main web host and the test will judge the CDN
                  provider as the host.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Occasionally, we may not be able to obtain results for The Green
                  Web Foundation API, in which case the test will state that the
                  website appears to be using bog standard energy. When this
                  happens, it is only ever temporary so try testing again the next
                  day.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h2>
                I changed my website but the test results don’t change. Why not?
              </h2>
              <p>
                We cache test results for one day, so if you are making changes to
                a website and testing each time, you won’t see any difference
                unless you wait until the next day and test again. This helps
                minimise the number of requests on the server, which is more
                sustainable.
              </p>
              <h2>Are test results public?</h2>
              <p>
                Yes, when you submit a url for testing, it generates a public
                report with the results.
              </p>
              <h2>Can I test private urls?</h2>
              <p>
                It depends on how you define private. You <em>can</em> test pages
                that are blocked from search engines, so long as they can be
                accessed without a password. Please be cautious testing these as
                every test will generate a public, search engine indexable results
                page (see below about deleting such pages).
              </p>
              <p>
                We <em>cannot</em> test pages protected by a password or on a
                local server. However, the carbon calculator code is open source
                so please do feel free to contribute a solution if this is
                something that you need.
              </p>
              <h2>Can you delete my test results?</h2>
              <p>
                If you have submitted a test and do not want the results public,
                then we have a simple policy.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If you tested a private development url
                  <em>by accident</em> (please don’t do it on purpose) and need to
                  delete the public results page, please get in touch and we will
                  delete the record as soon as we can.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you have tested a public url we will not delete the results.
                </li>
              </ol>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
